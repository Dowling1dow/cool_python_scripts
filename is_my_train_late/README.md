This is just a small script I created that will text me in the morning before I'm expected to leave my house and tell me if my train is going to be more than 5 minutes late.
Irish Rail have a habit of being late and I hated turning up to the station and having to stand on the platform for 15 minutes past the scheduled time of arrival.

The script runs on a server at a scheduled time 5 days during the week.
